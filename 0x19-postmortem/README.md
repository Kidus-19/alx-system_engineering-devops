Issue Summary:

Duration: February 15, 2024, 9:00 AM to February 15, 2024, 11:30 AM (PST)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage. Users were unable to access the service during the incident. Approximately 75% of users were affected.
Timeline:

9:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring systems reported a sudden drop in server response time.
9:05 AM: Engineers received automated alerts regarding the high error rate and slow response times.
9:10 AM: Initial investigation began, focusing on the application servers and load balancers.
9:30 AM: Database servers were examined as a potential cause due to recent updates.
10:00 AM: After analyzing logs and metrics, it was suspected that a recent code deployment might have caused the issue.
10:15 AM: The incident was escalated to the development and operations teams for further investigation.
10:30 AM: The team identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings and suspected it as the root cause.
10:45 AM: Load balancer configuration was rolled back to a known working state, but the issue persisted.
11:00 AM: Further investigation revealed a network connectivity issue between the load balancer and the application servers.
11:15 AM: Network operations team was engaged to troubleshoot and resolve the connectivity issue.
11:30 AM: The network connectivity issue was resolved, restoring full functionality to the web application.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to a network connectivity issue between the load balancer and the application servers.
Resolution: The misconfigured load balancer settings were rolled back to a known working configuration. Additionally, the network operations team identified and rectified the network connectivity issue, restoring normal functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance load balancer configuration management processes to prevent misconfigurations.
Implement more comprehensive testing and validation procedures for code deployments.
Strengthen network monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect connectivity issues promptly.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations and establish best practices.
Develop and implement automated testing and validation scripts for code deployments.
Enhance network monitoring by adding additional network health checks and alerts.
Conduct a post-incident review with all involved teams to share lessons learned and identify additional preventive measures.
This postmortem outlines an incident that occurred where a misconfigured load balancer and subsequent network connectivity issue caused a complete outage of a web application. The incident was detected through monitoring alerts, leading to an investigation of various components. The misconfiguration was identified as the root cause, and resolution involved rolling back the load balancer settings and resolving the network connectivity issue. Corrective measures were proposed to improve configuration management, testing procedures, and network monitoring. Specific tasks were outlined to address each issue and prevent similar incidents in the future.

By following these actions, the team aims to strengthen the overall stability and reliability of the web application, ensuring a better user experience and minimizing the impact of any future incidents.
